      <p>In the past, Nepal and Tibet had a vibrant trade relationship. So, Nepali merchants who were primarily from Newari community of Nepa learnt the recipe and started making a modified version of it back in their homes.
        Its popularity in modern day Nepal has risen because of its delicious taste. There is almost no Nepali restaurant across the globe where you would not find Momo in their menus!
        So, I would like to present the recipe of this famous Nepali dish to you. Although it requires many ingredients and a lot of effort, you will definitely find it worth at the end.
